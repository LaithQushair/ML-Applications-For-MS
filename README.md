# ML-Applications-For-MS

**Description**

This project leverages machine learning techniques to enhance the understanding and analysis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) through MRI datasets. Our objective is to use machine learning to differentiate between MRI scans from healthy control subjects and those from individuals diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. By applying advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide tools that assist neurologists and researchers in better assessing, diagnosing, and tracking the progression of MS. MS is one of the most commonly misdiagnosed diseases worldwide, and a misdiagnosis can and has lead to cases of early morbidity. For these reasons, we find it extremely important to take advantage of the technologies available today, such as AI, to make diagnostic tools that improve the conditions of those affected by MS and MS-related illnesses.
